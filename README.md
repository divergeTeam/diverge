## Diverge

### *What is Diverge????*
Diverge is an alternative to substratum. 

The core idea of Diverge is to be a cleaner minimalistic approach to substratum where everything we dont need is cut and everything we do need stays put.

All your favorite themes will work as normal.

We will be doing a simplified ui that requires a base of OMS (none of that legacy or sungstratum stuff)
